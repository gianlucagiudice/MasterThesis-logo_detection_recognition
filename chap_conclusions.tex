This thesis addressed the task of logo recognition by reformulating the problem in a class incremental learning approach.
The motivation behind the use of this technique is that new logos are constantly being created.
Consequently, an effective model should be able to keep up with introductions of new logos in order to recognize them, without the need to retrain a model but rather by integrating old knowledge with new knowledge.

To this end, a two-stage logo detector that consists of a first stage concerning the localization of logos in the image and a second stage regarding the actual classification of logos is used to address the problem.

The first stage consists in a class-agnostic logo detector, in this way it is possible to decouple the localization with the recognition, thus avoid the need to create a CIL logo detector. 
This approach proves to be successful, as a generic logo detector is able to learn what a logo is by using only an initial set of logos, this is enough to approximate the logo concept fairly well and thus generalize. The detector will then be able to detect logos that have never been seen before.

On the other hand, taking advantage of state-of-the-art incremental learning techniques, a CIL classifier is defined to accomplish the actual classification of logos, given the ROI provided by the agnostic detection of logos. Experiments show that a classifier trained in this fashion, storing 50 examples for old classes, performs well without too many drawbacks in terms of performance compared to a standard approach (according to the results of the baseline comparison).

A downside of the algorithm used for CIL is the number of model parameters.
The method implemented with learnable masks used to perform channel-level pruning of the CNN layers achieves promising performance when tested on a subset of the dataset. However, this approach performs poorly when trying to scale to the entire dataset. To solve this problem, Knowledge Distillation is used as an alternative approach to channel-level masks. In this way, it is possible to train a significantly smaller CNN with the supervision of a larger model resulting from the incremental learning phases. Note that, in the experiments conducted in this thesis, KD is applied at the end of each incremental learning task, however, the DER algorithm is flexible enough to be used in combination with KD after a certain number of incremental tasks.
Indeed, the resulting student model output from the KD can be used as a feature extractor for subsequent incremental learning iterations. It is sufficient to freeze the student weights trained with the KD and then expand the architecture with the DER like any other type of feature extractor.
However, this is true from a theoretical point of view and further experiments should be conducted to verify the effectiveness of this technique and evaluate its performance.

The final performance obtained by the system consisting of the class-agnostic logo detector trained on 1000 classes, and the CIL classifier trained width KD techniques, outperforms the end-to-end model proposed by the authors of LogoDet-3k \cite{wang2022logodet}.
On the other hand, the model proposed by Amazon in SeeTek \cite{li2022seetek} performs better on the LogoDet-3K dataset. However, it should be taken into account that SeeTek considers an open-set retrieval environment as opposed to an incremental learning setup considered in this thesis.
Furthermore, from the final results obtained by the proposed system emerges that logo detector acts as a bottleneck for the whole system, thus severely limiting the final performance.

Future improvements of this works could try to asses this problem related to the class-agnostic logo detector by considering a version of YOLO with a higher number of parameters and a greater image input size. However, this would lead to higher computational requirements to train the model, and both longer training and inference time. Another way to tackle this problem is to experiment with different architectures for the detector.
Additional improvements of the system are related to second stage of the pipeline performed by the CIL classifier.
The classification task could by improved by enriching the representation of each logo by considering, in addition to the visual feature, the textual component.
This approach adopted in the literature is very effective, since many logos have a text component that can be used to distinguish them. Further study can be conducted in the direction of explainability, which is a hot topic in artificial intelligence when using deep learning models. This research could investigate what the detector considers as logos and explain why such detection applies to a logo.
